President Corazon Aquino has agreed to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return to the Philippines so that the government can try him on charges of stealing billions of dollars, newspapers said Saturday.
The reports did not say when criminal charges against Marcos, Aquino's ousted predecessor, will be filed or when Mrs. Aquino will allow him to return.
Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos into the Philippines, citing security reasons.
But the government has not done so because of Mrs. Aquino's refusal to let Marcos enter the country.
Marcos' wife Imelda appealed today to Mrs. Aquino to ``open her heart'' and allow the former president to return.
``This is for reconciliation, this is what's best for the country,'' Imelda said.
Rafael Ileto, Mrs. Aquino's national security advisor, said granting such a request was still an option but, ``I doubt very much that it will be one of the solutions.''
The 71-year-old Marcos was in critical condition Friday in a Honolulu hospital after emergency kidney surgery.
Marcos has lived in Hawaii since he was ousted three years ago in a popular uprising that propelled Mrs. Aquino to power.
``My countrymen, I am appealing to each and every one of you to pray that, hopefully, Mrs. Aquino will know that bringing home Marcos will bring true reconciliation, true peace and unity for our country,'' Mrs. Marcos said.
Mrs. Aquino, on the first stop of her weeklong three-nation European tour, met with West German President Richard von Weizsaecker, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and other officials.
She said that since her government took over in 1986, the country's growth rate of minus 10 percent under Marcos in 1985 had improved to a rate of plus 6.7 percent by 1988.
