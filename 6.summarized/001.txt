West Yorkshire Police searched six houses in Leeds today in connection with the London bombings.
Access to one house was gained using a robot-deployed controlled explosion. Other houses were entered by armed police.
London Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Ian Blair said that the operation "is directly connected to the outrages on Thursday".
A "significant amount" of explosives was recovered from the Burley property.
Around 600 people were evacuated from the surrounding area.
The Metropolitan Police released two photographs at 15:30 today as a result of an intense investigation into London bomb attacks of last week.
He was seen at Luton Station at 07.20 on the morning of the bombings.
Ms North also quotes a number of other survivors: "We are constantly reminded that this is the worst peace time bombing London has ever seen, for something that bad there should be an inquiry. People died, families lost someone they loved and hundreds are still suffering. You can't put a price on that but apparently the government can." - "Fiona"
Relatives of the dead have also been very critical. Quoted on the BBC's website, Saba Mozakka, the daughter of Behnaz Mozakka,who died in the Piccadilly Line explosion, said: "The families will be campaigning for there to be a full public inquiry. A narrative of events will not satisfy anybody. This is not something we will go away on."
Tributes were also paid at Tavistock Square where a bus was attacked at 9:47 a.m. BST this day one year ago.
Scotland Yard says the practice run shows 'terrorist methodology'. Over 3,000 witness statements have been gathered and 80,000 CCTV tapes analysed, and the investigation is expected to carry on for many months to come.
